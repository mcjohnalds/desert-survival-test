- fix bug where terrain regens funny on editor load
- handle case where not every constant is 100
- specify height map resource as export
- test for bug where heightmap is slightly off shader verts
- generate shader material at runtime so it doesn't get saved in git
- should i handle case where terrain is not centered?
