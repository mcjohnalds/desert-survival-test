Tasks:

- Only nearest groundwater should make noise
- Lizard model
- Lizard animations
- Lizard animation blending
- Water bottle item
  - Limited "ammo"
  - Drink to restore water level
  - Use on water source to fill
- Grabbable scrap metal

  - Grabbable item
  - Disappears with message on grab

  - Crafting UI
  - When equipped, tilts toward water sources
- Building to explore

- Make axe create impact effect
  - Make axe animation different depending on whether axe hit something
- Player starts with hand then unlocks axe
- Digging a vertex is more effective when nearby vertexes have a y height that
  is lower than the vertex being dug
- Sometimes, the player has to cut through roots to dig further
- Groundwater is more likely under especially dense and green patches of grass
- Make groundwater more quiet depending on how much dirt there is between the
  camera and the groundwater
  - Also change tone of sound
- Enemy cone of vision
- Rebake nav when terrain changes
- Hitting with axe reduces health and stuns lizard for a moment
  - Requires high skill to win fight, should be a last resort
- Should I allow the player to dig defensive trenches?
- Improve AI state transition trigger logic
  - Prevent player from exploiting the fact that the AI will not attack when
    returning home
  - Reset finish attacking player cooldown when damage is done or received
- Make lizard rotate better when navigating through a doorway
- Make AI move faster when attacking
- Make lizard rotate to face target when heading home
- Slight enemy damage cooldown
- Ground should regen
  - Maybe regen when not dug for a while

  - Maybe gradual

Big ideas:

- Multiple time-sensitive open loops running at once
- Start weak, have to stay indoors at night
- End-game player can dominate the night
- Game is viscerally enjoyable early and late game
- Hook player into wanting to dominate the night
- Make the night scary during early game
